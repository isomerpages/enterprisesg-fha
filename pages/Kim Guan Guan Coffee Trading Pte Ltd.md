			<h6 style="text-transform: uppercase; color: black;">Kim Guan Guan Singapore Traditional Coffee Power and Tea Dust</h6>
			<p>Singapore Traditional Coffee is a uniquely Singaporean product with a long history and culture. It is first roasted with caramelised sugar and margarine, and then brewed using a traditional ""hand-pulling"" method, which allows the brew to achieve a silky-smooth consistency.</p>
			<p>The unique Singapore kopi is made from Robusta beans, which contain a higher dosage of caffeine. Singapore Coffee's own uniquely aromatic and full-bodied taste is also what differs it from International Gourmet Coffee which is brewed using Arabica coffee.</p>
			<p>KGG's vision is to produce top quality traditional coffee through continuous improvement in the manufacturing process with the mission to preserve and share the unique culture of traditional coffee in Singapore to one and all.</p>
