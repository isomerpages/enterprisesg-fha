<h6 style="text-transform: uppercase; color: black;">Lion Dance Brand, Pork Ball
</h6> 
<p>Our best seller meatball since 1986. Preserving the most traditional recipe since the start, this is the "Original Recipe" that our founders have passed down and we continue to make it the correct way. The unique taste about our Pork Ball comes from a Teochew recipe. Because Teochews love to add sole fish in their cooking, and we have derived the formulation with that in mind. Lion Dance Brand meatball uses a high percentage of meat in our recipe, hence you will not feel like you are eating flour, as compared to many other meatballs available in the market. We do not stinge on our cuttlefish, as this provided a natural flavour to our meatball instead of using chemical flavouring.

</h6> 
<p>One of consumers favorite meatball is the Pork Mushroom Ball. Lion Dance Brand Pork Mushroom ball is perfectly blended with dried Shitake mushroom. Every bite is crunchy and there are bits of shitake mushroom with every bite. Also good for those who doesn't like the over-powering taste of cuttlefish/solefish in our ORIGINAL RECIPE. Lion Dance Brand meatball uses a high percentage of meat in our recipe, hence you will not feel like you are eating flour, as compared to many other meatballs available in the market. We do not stinge on our mushroom in this recipe, so it is wickedly fragrant.
