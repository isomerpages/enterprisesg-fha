		<p>Our Pan-Fried Mandu is filled with shrimp, squid, tuna, chives, green onion, glass noodles, and tofu. Its unique flat rectangular-shaped design is meant to increase the surface area of the dumpling making it ideal for pan frying. The green hue of the mandu skin owes its appearance to the aromatic green laver powder it is made out of. Combined with the rich mix of seafood, this mandu makes for a flavourful bite that holds a tinge of saltiness reminiscent of the sea.

Our Shrimp Gyoza is deliciously filled with the finest shrimp, squid, white cabbage, onions, pollock and tofu. This mixture of ingredients strikes a great balance between savoury and sweet. The delicate yet refreshing flavour is ideally steamed and served as a starter, side dish, or snack.</p></div>
