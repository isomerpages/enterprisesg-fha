		<h6 style="text-transform: uppercase; color: black;">Anarkali Gold Whole Wheat Atta Flour</h6>
		<p>Anarkali's Chakki Fresh Whole Wheat Gold Atta Flour is a unique type of pulverized whole wheat flour, derived from milling the whole wheat kernel with the bran to a fine material. The unique premium quality of this product,  Chapatis ( Indian Wholemeal bread ) produced remains soft, fluffy and light as freshly made even after 8 hours. The milling process breaks down the integrity of the starch and protein within the wheat kernel releasing a more sweet flavour as well as giving it a slight roasted texture, flavour and aroma due to the heat produced in the milling process. This type of flour is mainly used in Indian cuisines for the creation of flatbreads, like chapati, tandoori roti, paratha etc.</p></div>
