			<h4 style="text-transform: uppercase; color: black;"><b>Tan Seng Kee Foods Pte Ltd</b></h4>
			<p>Tan Seng Kee Foods Pte Ltd (TSK), a heritage brand since 1936, began as a family business with original recipes passed down through generations. Staying true to its authentic and wholesome flavours, it has since evolved into a research focused noodle institution manufacturing fresh rice-based, fresh cooked and raw wheat-based noodles. As the noodle maker to pioneer Singapore’s first pasteurized fresh noodles back in 2010, Kang Kang noodles provides modern consumers convenience and peace of mind through its preservative-free, “springier” and tastier noodles with an extended shelf life from mere days to months.</p>
			<p>TSK has long established itself as a trusted noodle maker with ISO 22000:2018, Halal, gluten-free certification and a brand ambassador of Tasty Singapore. TSK has expanded into export markets, bringing a slice of Singapore’s delicious staple into Europe, Middle East and the United States of America.</p>
