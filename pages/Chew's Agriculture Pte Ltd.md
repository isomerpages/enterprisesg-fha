		<p>Proudly produced locally, Chew’s Fresh Eggs are stocked on retail shelves within 24 hours of being laid. This means quality eggs at their freshest, and a lower carbon footprint compared to imported produce.


Highly nutritious and key to a healthy, balanced diet, Chew’s Fresh Eggs are also fortified with Vitamin E and other essential nutrients. A huge benefit of Vitamin E is its ability to strengthen the body’s immune system, as well as aid in maintaining healthy skin and eyes.

Chew's Organic Selenium Eggs</h6>
		<p>Human intake is very much dependant on the environment in which crops, plants and livestock are raised, due to the soil selenium levels that influence how much of the trace mineral enters the food chain. However, selenium can also be obtained through good dietary sources which include nuts, grains and vegetables.

Chew’s Organic Selenium Eggs contain consistently higher selenium levels, due to the transference of the mineral from our hens’ feed – enriched using Alltech's proprietary technology

		<h6 style="text-transform: uppercase; color: black;">Chew's Omega 3 Eggs</h6>
		<p>FAMILY FAVOURITE

These nutritious eggs contain Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids – healthier fats which include ALA, EPA and DHA, offering many powerful health benefits for the body and brain.

  

​

  

Key benefits of ALA:

  

Protects against damage to the body's cells and serves vital functions at the cellular level, such as producing energy. It's beneficial to the young and old!
			
Key benefits of EPA:

Helps to prevent the blood from clotting easily, reduces triglyceride levels in the blood, and has effects that might reduce pain and swelling.

Key benefits of DHA:
			
Linked to improved heart health, better vision, and reduced inflammatory response, it's also essential for early brain development. To achieve adequate amounts of DHA, it's important to include dietary sources such as cold-water fish, grass-fed meat and dairy products.

		<h6 style="text-transform: uppercase; color: black;">Chew's Eggs with Omega 6</h6>
		<p>DAILY ESSENTIAL

Along with Omega-3 fatty acids, Omega-6 fatty acids play a crucial role in brain function, and normal growth and development.

As a type of polyunsaturated fatty acid, it helps stimulate skin and hair growth, maintain bone health, regulate metabolism and maintain the reproductive system.

Omega-6 Eggs have a higher concentration of Linoleic acid – thought to decrease the risk of heart disease and reduce total and LDL cholesterol.
			
These eggs also contain highly desirable aromatic yolks. </p></div>

		<h6 style="text-transform: uppercase; color: black;">Chew's Cage-Free Eggs</h6>
Chew’s Cage-Free Eggs are officially Certified Humane, which means our laying hens in the programme are raised under a set of strict standards that ensure optimal farm animal welfare. This accounts for the whole life cycle of our cage-free hens.
The hens live in a specially designed aviary system with features for hygiene and comfort, and are free to roam about the entire facility.
		
Features include::
Perches
Nest boxes
Dust-bathing areas
Fresh food and water points

Aviary System
Besides having freedom of movement, they can also engage in natural behaviour such as stretching their wings, perching, playing in the dirt and relaxing.

Cage-Free Life
Chew’s Cage-Free Eggs are produced locally – the only one of its kind – and Singapore’s high standards in food production ensures their quality and safety.

Our fresh eggs reach you quicker and fresher than imported produce. Not only that – because logistics is more straightforward, this means value for money and a reduced carbon footprint.</p></div>
