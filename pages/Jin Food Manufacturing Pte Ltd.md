		<h6 style="text-transform: uppercase; color: black;"><!--insert product name before </h6> and product description after <p>-->Tropics, Natural Lime Juice (100% Pure)</h6>
		<p>Freshly squeezed 100% calamansi lime juice rich in Vitamin C that aids in your immunity system. We can go on and on about the endless benefits of calamansi lime, but we prefer that you try it yourself.

Every bottle is a concentrated 100% pure calamansi lime juice, so we will need to dilute with water to drink it. The mixing proportion is up to the individual, but we suggest to dilute 1 part of lime juice to 5 parts of water. Serve over ice for a greater taste. Each bottle is 1 Litre in size, and can make approximately up to 25 cups of lime juice.

This is the PURE version, so if you want to drink it direct, it is not advisable. You should add some honey or sugar to your preference. Since it is PURE, there are variations of usage to this. You can use it in your cooking, or as a condiment to replace your usual lime. It is the real lime juice you squeezed from lime directly.</p></div>
