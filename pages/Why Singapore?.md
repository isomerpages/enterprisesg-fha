**Singapore houses a vibrant ecosystem that spans across 14 globally leading industries.** With a flourishing entrepreneurial landscape that features over 3,800 tech startups, 220 investors, and 200 incubators and accelerators, Singapore continues to be a thriving hub for business opportunities and innovation.

#### World-class connectivity

Singapore offers world-class connectivity and serves as a **global gateway to regional opportunities** thanks to its strategic location at the intersection of major trade routes. By air, Singapore is within a six-hour radius of any country in Southeast Asia.
