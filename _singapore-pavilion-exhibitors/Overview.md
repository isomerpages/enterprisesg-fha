### Singapore's Food Manufacturing Industry

*Singapore is a renowned food capital in Asia, characterised by diversity, passion, and innovation behind every product and dish. To meet changing demands and maintain their gold standard of quality, Singapore consistently invests in their food capabilities to continuously improve and adapt alongside the evolving F&B landscape.*

**Singapore has a vibrant food ecosystem** consisting of players across the food value chain. This ranges from pre-harvest activity such as agri and aqua tech to a diverse base of food processing and manufacturing players, including a growing pool of food tech startups, as well as extensive logistics and trade networks and a dynamic HORECA sector.

Despite the pandemic, **Singapore’s food manufacturing output reached $10.3 billion in 2021**, achieving a +2% year-on-year compound annual growth rate from $9.4 billion in 2016. Of this, about 60% was exported to cater to **growing global demand** for Singapore food products. In addition, Singapore’s food tech industry has been able capture the interests of venture capitalists and angel investors, with **investments growing from $177 million in 2019 to $195 million in 2020** (ASEAN 2020 AgriFoodTech Investment Report, AgFunder; 2021 AgFunder AgriFoodTech Investment Report, AgFunder).

Local food manufacturers and startups continue to **leverage continuous innovation** to find better ways to produce the foods that cater to customers’ evolving needs and demands. This includes consumers’ demand for healthy, sustainable foods in areas such as alternative proteins, functional foods, etc.  

In partnership with the Singapore Food Authority (SFA), Singapore’s food manufacturers are also dedicated to upholding world-class food safety and quality standards. This is achieved through stringent product testing with the SFA, and by **obtaining internationally recognised certifications and standards** (e.g. ISO 22000, HACCP, FSSC 22000). 

Backed by concerted government efforts, extensive industry partnerships, and comprehensive quality and safety standards, Singapore’s world-class innovation and manufacturing capabilities will continue to uphold Singapore as a leading food and nutrition hub serving the needs of global consumers.
