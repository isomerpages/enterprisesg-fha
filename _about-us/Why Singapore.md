<p><strong>Why Singapore?</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore is Southeast Asia’s smallest country, located off the southern
tip of the Malay Peninsula. As home to a population of 5.45 million people
(Department of Statistics), Singapore has grown into an economic powerhouse
despite its size. It is one of the world’s most competitive economies (International
Institute for Management Development (IMD) World Competitiveness Rankings
2021, IMD) and the second most innovative country in Asia (Global Innovation
Index 2021, Cornell University, INSEAD, and WIPO).</p>
<p>Singapore houses a vibrant ecosystem that spans across 14 globally leading
industries. With a flourishing entrepreneurial landscape that features
over 3,800 tech startups, 220 investors, and 200 incubators and accelerators,
Singapore continues to be a thriving hub for business opportunities and
innovation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>World-class connectivity</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore offers world-class connectivity and serves as a global gateway
to regional opportunities thanks to its strategic location at the intersection
of major trade routes. By air, Singapore is within a six-hour radius of
any country in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Beyond Southeast Asia, Singapore’s multiple award-winning Changi Airport
serves more than 100 airlines and 100 countries and territories worldwide.
By sea, the Port of Singapore sees more than 130,000 ships call annually
and has links to more than 600 ports globally. The country’s free trade
agreement network consists of 27 agreements worldwide and covers over 86%
of global GDP, making Singapore one of the most globally connected countries
in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A global hub for business</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore is the location of choice for many businesses, serving as headquarters
for companies of all sizes ranging from startups to multinational corporations.
In particular, as one of Asia’s leading innovation centres (Global Innovation
Index 2021, Cornell University, INSEAD, and WIPO), the country is recognised
for its vibrant ecosystem that features a comprehensive network of cutting-edge
R&amp;D labs, venture capital funds, incubators, and accelerators.</p>
<p>Singapore is also home to a diverse and exceptional talent pool. Ranked
Asia’s best in attracting and enabling talent (The Global Talent Competitiveness
Index 2020, INSEAD), Singapore invests in a range of national initiatives
and academic-industry partnerships to continuously improve their highly
educated and skilled workforce.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A great place to live</strong>
</p>
<p>With one of the highest standards of living in the world, Singapore is
internationally regarded for its high levels of safety, world-class healthcare,
and top-notch education. Integral to the Singapore lifestyle is our hawker
culture, the communal culinary and dining experience which serves as an
embodiment of Singapore’s dynamic multicultural society. Singapore’s hawker
culture was the country’s first inscription on the UNESCO Representative
List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2020.</p>
